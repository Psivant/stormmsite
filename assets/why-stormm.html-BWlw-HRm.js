However, in most cases the histories of these codes predates the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology that has proven so amenable to classical particle simulations, and as a consequence these codes build on designs which may be as much as forty years old. Even in the past ten years, GPU architectures have grown so rapidly that what used to be considered medium to large problems are not big enough to utilize the entirety of the most powerful cards.</p><h2 id="a-workbench-for-implementing-molecular-models" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-workbench-for-implementing-molecular-models"><span>A Workbench for Implementing Molecular Models</span></a></h2><p>STORMM provides a rich C++ framework for reading molecular coordinates and model parameters (topologies), manipulating their class objects with built-in routines, and parsing them into work units that distribute the work over a wide GPU.
