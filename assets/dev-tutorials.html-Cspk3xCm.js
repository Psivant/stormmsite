STORMM's Python bindings are in development, and the project is intended to let not only its compiled applications but its individual objects to be created and manipulated from within a Python framework. For now, we advise prospective developers to work within the STORMM source code, following the path laid out by other applications which compile with the main build. The libraries are modular, the pieces are there. Rather than a scripting environment, however, custom applications with STORMM must be compiled, custom input control blocks written in the native C++ rather than through an interpreter which translates a script into that language. It's not hard, however, and we hope that the journey will provide those who take it with a greater appreciation for how Python and HPC computing work at a level closer to the "bare metal."`,-1),s=e("h2",{id:"a-basic-gpu-program-in-stormm",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#a-basic-gpu-program-in-stormm"},[e("span",null,"A Basic GPU Program in STORMM")])],-1),l=e("p",null,"Before diving into the molecular mechanics capabilities, understand the means by which STORMM identifies an available GPU, manages memory on the CPU host and GPU device, and transfers data between the two resources.
